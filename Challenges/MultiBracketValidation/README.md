Given a string, search through the string to see if there are an brackets {}, (), [], if there are brackets present, search to see if the matching bracket exists.

##Approach and efficiency BigO sp O(n) T O(n), 
Using a stack, I used a for loop to search through the string to find brackets. I then pushed the brackets into a stack, I then has a series of if statments where I determined whether or not the matching bracket exists in the string.
