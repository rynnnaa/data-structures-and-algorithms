# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
Traverse through a tree to find the max value among the nodes

## Challenge
Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of doing a traversal through the tree and comparing the value of the node to the max node
Big O
Time O(n)
Space O(w)
