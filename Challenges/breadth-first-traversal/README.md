# Breadth-first
Traversing a tree using breadth first method and returning the value of the nodes

## Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach for this challenge is using breadth first approach, and saving the nodes into a queue, using the peek of the queue to output, whilst using enqueue and dequeue methods to go thorough the tree
Big O
Time O(n)
Space O(w)
