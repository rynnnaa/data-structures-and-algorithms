# Intersection of binary trees
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
Using recursion, go through tree and add values into hash set
Big O
T O(n)
S O(n)

## Solution
