# Breadth-First Traversal of a Graph
 breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O
Time O(n)
Space O(v) going through each vertex
