# Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
Creating a queue using two stacks

## Challenge
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement the standard queue interface, but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:
enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
BigO
Time O(1)
Space O(1)
