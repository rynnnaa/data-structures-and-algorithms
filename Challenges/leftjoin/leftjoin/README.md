# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Challenge
Create a method that left joins two hashmaps into a single data structure.

The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to left join logic.

## Approach & Efficiency
BIG O
T O(n)
S O(n)
