##Binary Tree Height
Find the height of a binary tree

## Challenge
Write a method that calculates the height of a binary tree

## Approach & Efficiency
Using the recursive depth first method to determine the depth of the left and right, and compare the value to of both sides to return the greater height.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(h)
