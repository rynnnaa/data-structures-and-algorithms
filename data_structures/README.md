# Singly Linked List
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

Append values, Insert Before, Insert After

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Head property included in LinkedList class. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.Insert method which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance. Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O
Time O(n)
Space O(n)

## API
Insert, Include and Print are all implemented methods that insert include and print linked list.
