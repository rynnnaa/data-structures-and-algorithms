### Implement A Queue Using Two Stacks
TThis app contains the data structure for building and traversing a binary tree in Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order, as well as building binary search trees, inserting new nodes in order, and testing to determine if a node value exists in the binary search tree.

### Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class.
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
- Create a BinarySearchTree class
- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
- At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

### Approach & Efficiency
Binary Tree: Big O Space = O(H); Big O Time = O(n)
- The methods in the BinaryTree class use recursion to traverse the entire tree, storing node values in a defined List that is then converted to an array before returning. Space in depth first recursion traversal is measured by the height of the tree.

Binary Search Tree: Big O Space = O(1); Big O Time = O(log n)
- Adding and searching the binary search tree uses a while loop instead of recursion, and since nothing is being added to the call stack, space is just O(1). Also, since the tree is only traversed using > or < comparisons to the current root node, not every node on the tree needs to be touched, thus time is O(log n) instead of n.


### Application Programming Interface
Binary Tree:
- PreOrder() - Recursively stores the node values of the tree BEFORE traversing to the next and returns them as an array.
- InOrder() - Stores the node values of the tree, starting at the left most leaf and recursively adding back upward, then adding as it goes down the right side, and returns them as an array.
- PostOrder - Stores the node values of the tree, returning the left side of the tree from the bottom up, then the right side from the bottom up, then finally the top root, then returns them as an array.

Binary Search Tree:
- Add(Node root, int value) - Traverses the nodes of the binary search tree that are directly greater than of less than the given value. When it reaches a leaf, it creates a new node in the position greater than or less than that leaf.
- Contains(int value) - Searches the tree for a matching node value, traversing left if the target value is less than the node value, or right if the target value is greater than the node value. Returns true is target is found, false if not.
